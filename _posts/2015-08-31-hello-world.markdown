We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the biggest Google related event in Berlin - [GDG DevFest Berlin 2015](https://2015.devfest-berlin.de/). 

This year event will take place at ImmobilienScout24 like the last two times. Thanks to ImmobilienScout24 for hosting us again and also offering drinks and catering.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 250 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 48 hours of pure Google technologies 
* **Date**: 13-15 of November, starting with several workshops on fridays, conference with the parallel tracks on aturday and also a hakathon on sunday for showing the learned techniques
* **Venue**: ImmobilienScout24 in Friedrichhain near Ost-Bahnhof in Andreasstra√üe 10, 12043 Berlin
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of call for participation
