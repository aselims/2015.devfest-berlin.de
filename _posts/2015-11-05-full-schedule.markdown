Schedule for DevFest Berlin 2015 has been finalized

#### Heureka - We have a final schedule

Creating a community event of this scale is not easy, especially when you are trying to fill 3 parallel tracks and workshops. Luckily we received plenty of submissions of high quality so we needed to take a little while to figure out what the best mix of topics and experience levels would be.

[The final schedule](/schedule) is now live and we hope you'll like what you see.

This year we have the luxury to not only hear the best and brightest from the Berlin community and beyond but also will be able to welcome a bunch of speakers from Google: Cloud Platform, Google Maps, Google Play and Android Developer Advocate - we'll have them all. Just take a look at [this impressive list of speakers](/speakers) - we couldn't be happier!
