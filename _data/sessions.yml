  title: "We can't use Angular. It will hurt our SEO."
  description: "Lots of myths surrounded and still surround the search rankings of fully dynamic web apps since their introduction. We took the bet of building an AngularJS web app that did not make tradeoffs on either speed, usability and a strong SEO channel - show how we did it, and which problems came up. We didn't just achieve our goals, but in some ways could even leverage opportunities that would not have been possible with a classic web page. We'll also present how we went on from there to create one of the most performant current hybrid mobile apps from the very same code base."
